What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- when you initialize a repository, you create a new space where you can track and save commits 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- The staging area is a middle ground from the working directory and the repository. It is valuable for keeping finished work that is ready to be saved, out of the working directory but saved for later to be added all in the same commit that the remainder of your work will also be added to.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
- store the commit here until you have completed the section you are working on to commit. You can store it here so you do not lose track of what you are working on.
