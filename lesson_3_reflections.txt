When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Benefit of copy of latest known state of teh remote stored locally is that you can go back to fix contradictions when mulitple versions are pushed to git. 


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Typically you would have to send versions back and forth between muliple people working on the same project and collaborate with one another who made what changes. 
It is much easier using github to keep the work organized and clean. Work can be revised before being added to the main project which is very helpful with experimentation. 


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When you want to show your work that you have made to others for feedback and review before merging to master. 
Allows for time to collaborate with others before changing out from under others.
